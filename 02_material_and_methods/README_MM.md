## Hardware details

For self-built hardware, it is recommended to have a special repository for its description and link it with a URL or as a submodule here. For any hardware, you should provide a user guide with the following information:

- How to check the hardware is working: calibration, validation
- Troubleshooting guide, common issues
- What was bought were?
- What was custom-built, by whom and how ?
- Critical hardware parts, what could be modified?
- Schematics and/or photos (lots of photos)
